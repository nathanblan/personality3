The Purpose of this analysis is to identify relations between character traits and educational outcomes, which can help explain greater social trends globally. I will be using the following data sets: 

PISA Scores 2015: https://www.kaggle.com/zazueta/pisa-scores-2015?select=Pisa+mean+performance+scores+2013+-+2015+Definition+and+Source.csv
	Every four years, the Programme for International Student Assessment randomly samples students from each country and gives them a standardized test. This data is the result of that process. In our analysis, we will be focusing on scores from the 2015 test.
  
Big Five Personality Test: https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/big-five-personality-test
	The Big Five personality traits, also known as the five-factor model (FFM) and the OCEAN model, is a grouping for personality traits. Psychologists have narrowed down human behavior to just 5 most significant traits, being extraversion (EXT), neuroticism (EST), agreeableness (AGR), conscientiousness (CSN), and openness (OPN). This dataset contains 1,015,342 questionnaire answers collected online by Open Psychometrics. 
  
Countries ISO Codes: https://www.kaggle.com/juanumusic/countries-iso-codes
	The dataset contains a list of all the countries and their codes. Any dataset that contains a country column, can be linked to this dataset and be used to link other data, as well as plotting maps.
